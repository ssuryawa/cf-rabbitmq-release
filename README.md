# Cloud Foundry RabbitMQ Service - Test

This repository contains the release for RabbitMQ for Cloud Foundry.
It is deployable by BOSH in the usual way.

## Updating

Clone the repository and run `./scripts/update-release`.

## Deploying

Run the `scripts/deploy-release` script. Examples as follows:

```
# Deploying locally to BOSH lite
export BOSH_MANIFEST=../london-ci-tools/manifests/rabbitmq/develop/development/bosh-lite.yml
./scripts/deploy-release lite

# Deploying to a different BOSH director
export BOSH_MANIFEST=/path/to/manifest.yml
./scripts/deploy-release my-bosh-alias
```

Note that the argument is a BOSH alias, which you must have configured prior to running the script. E.G.

```
bosh target https://192.168.50.4:25555 lite
```
